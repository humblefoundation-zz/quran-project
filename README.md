# quran-project
The Humble Foundation Qur'an Project in LaTeX format.

See [the project page](http://humblefoundation.org/quran) and [this introductory blog post](http://www.humblefoundation.org/blog/our-first-blog-post-on-relocation-and-translation), as well as [this one](http://www.humblefoundation.org/blog/publishing-a-book-with-latex-part-one).

You can compile this yourself on Mac OS X, by installing [BasicTex](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html), and adding the following packages using [TexLive](http://amaxwell.github.io/tlutility/): comment, tagging, bigfoot, bashful, ncctools. Similar software exists for the PC, although we don't provide download instructions here.

Then, compile in the root of the project folder with: `xelatex -shell-escape -file-line-error -recorder quran-project.tex`
